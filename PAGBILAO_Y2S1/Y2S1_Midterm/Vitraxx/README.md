Vitraxx is a group project, serving as our submission for the Young Creatives Challenge 2024, and as the Midterm Exams for CGD 2101 and CGD 2102.

Vitraxx is a linear-story visual novel. The game features a short hidden object minigame.

The code is worked on by 2 people, but every script is worked on by only one person. The scripts in this folder are the ones I worked on.

The code, including ones I did not work on, reapplies a study on game object activation and deactivation, scene loading, and button interactions.
