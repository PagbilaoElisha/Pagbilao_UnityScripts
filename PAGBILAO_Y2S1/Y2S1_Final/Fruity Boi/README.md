Fruity Boi is a solo project, serving as the Final Exam for CGD 2101.

Fruity Boi is a 2D platformer game with 8 levels at a static camera view. The game is incomplete, as level repetition doesn't work properly, likely caused by improperly implementing all levels to one project scene. The obstacles (i.e. spikes) do not kill the opponent either.

The code applies a study on tilemaps, 2D physics, and sprite animation.
