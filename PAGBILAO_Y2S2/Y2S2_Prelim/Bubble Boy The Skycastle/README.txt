Bubble Boy: The Skycastle is a group project, serving as our submission for the Young Creatives Challenge 2024, and as the Prelimm Exam for CGD 2202.

Bubble Boy: the Skycastle is a 2D endless arcade-style game akin to Flappy Bird where the player must jump through gaps formed by rocks without ever touching the bottom of the level.

The code is collaboratively worked on by 4 people. The codes placed here are the ones I worked on.

The code, including ones I did not work on, applies a study on 2D physics, cinemachine, and game states.
