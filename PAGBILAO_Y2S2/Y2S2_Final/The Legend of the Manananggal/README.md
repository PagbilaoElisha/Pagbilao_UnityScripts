The Legend of the Manananggal is a group project, serving as our semester-long project for CEM 2202: Design and Production Theories. As of writing, it is also enforced to be the Final Exam for CGD 2201, but is not worked on at the moment.

The Legend of the Manananggal is a single-player puzzle platformer where the player has to control the bodies of a manananggal (a vampire-like monster whose main gimmick is that her upper body separates from her legs) with the goal of joining them together.

The code is collaboratively worked on by 3 people. The codes placed here are the ones I worked on.

The code, including ones I did not work on, reapplies a study on 2D physics.
