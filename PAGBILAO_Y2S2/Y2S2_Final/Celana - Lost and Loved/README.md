Celana: Lost and Loved is a group project, serving as our submission for the Aral Arcade Game Jam, the third Final activity for CGD 2203, and the Final Project for CGD 2202 and CGD 2203.

Celana: Lost and Loved is a platformer game where the player plays as the eponymous doll who makes it her goal to reunite with her owner by jumping her way out of her owner's room. The player collects items that help her throughout the game and solves her way out of typing tests, the latter of which is a requirement of the game jam.

The code is collaboratively worked on by 3 people. The codes placed here are the ones I worked on.

The code, including ones I did not work on, reapplies a study on 2D physics and cinemachine, and applies a study on using line renderers for physics and input fields.
