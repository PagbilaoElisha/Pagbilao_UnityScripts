Spirit Slingers is a solo project, serving as the Final Exam for CGD 2202 and CGD 2203.

Spirit Slingers is a physics-based puzzle game in the style of Angry Birds. More akin to Angry Birds 2, the player can choose which item to launch to the opponents, albeit with a set limited number per level compared to Angry Birds 2. Each item has a different effect that only happens upon collision with objects.

The code reapplies a study on 2D physics and cinemachine, and applies a study on slingshot-like physics and prefab instantiating.
