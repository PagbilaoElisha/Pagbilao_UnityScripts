CCSS Students is a solo project, serving as a laboratory study for CGD 2203.

CCSS Students has no build file and only consists of the eight scripts in this folder. The goal of the code is to have the ability to assign the various Student subclasses to some game objects and perform the actions of the base class Student.

The code applies a study on inheritance, polymorphism, and method overriding.
