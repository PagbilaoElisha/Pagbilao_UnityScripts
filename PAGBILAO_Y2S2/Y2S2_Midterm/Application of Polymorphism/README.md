Application of Polymorphism is a solo project, serving as the first Midterm activity for CGD 2203.

Application of Polymorphism has no build file and only consists of the two scripts in this folder. The goal of the code is to have the ability to assign the Sword subclass to a game object and perform the actions of the base class Weapon.

The code applies a study on polymorphism, method overriding, abstract classes, and method overloading.
