Adventurer Classes is a solo project, serving as the third activity for CGD 2203.

Adventurer Classes is a button selection scene where buttons are arranged in a binary tree structure and showcase abilities unique to different subclasses.

The code applies a study on inheritance, polymorphism, and line rendering (by setting the UI canvas on World View).
